### What FlippingNotch is not
It is not a framework, it is just a Dribble inspired project https://dribbble.com/shots/4089014-Pull-To-Refresh-iPhone-X

### Requirements
FlippingNotch is written in Swift 4.0, in Xcode 9.0 and required an iPhone X Simulator/Device.

### Limitations
The animation works as expected only in iPhone X in portrait mode

### TODO
- Include the case when a NavigationBar is implemented.
